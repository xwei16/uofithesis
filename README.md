## Using This Template

### Overleaf

You can use this template on Overleaf, in which case you don't need to worry about installing TeX Live locally.

You **must have** a Standard, Professional, or Student license to use Overleaf, 
as the free version times out when building documents with the tagging system enabled.

1. Download the template as a ZIP file from the GitHub page.
2. Select *New project* -> *Upload project* on Overleaf and upload the ZIP file.
3. Open *Settings* using the gear icon in the bottom left, click the *Compiler* tab, and select "LuaLaTeX" from the *Compiler* dropdown menu.
4. Open `thesis.tex` and click "Recompile" to build the document.

#### TeX Live Version on Overleaf

Overleaf's TeX Live is not as up to date as a local installation. You will
likely see build warnings about the tagging system, but the document should 
still compile.

Using [Overleaf Labs](https://www.overleaf.com/labs/participate) to get access
to the Rolling Release reduces warnings. This is optional. Make sure to change
the TeX Live version in the project settings to "Rolling Release" to use it.

### Local TeX Installation

We recommend cloning the repository to get started:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/graduatecollege/uofithesis.git
```

Or you can download the code as a ZIP file from the GitHub page.

> [!NOTE]
> Because accessible PDF generation is so new to the LaTeX ecosystem,
> downloading the template for your use is the most effective way
> to ensure you can customize and build your document without issues. We
> don't have plans to publish this class on CTAN until the tagging system 
> is more mature and stable.

## Requirements

This template requires **TeX Live 2025** or later and must be compiled with **LuaLaTeX**.

### Installing TeX Live 2025

For complete instructions refer to the [TeX Live website](https://www.tug.org/texlive/).
Here are the basic steps for each platform:

#### Windows

Download and run the installer from https://www.tug.org/texlive/windows.html

#### macOS

```bash
# Install MacTeX (includes TeX Live 2025)
# Download from https://www.tug.org/mactex/
# Or use Homebrew:
brew install --cask mactex
```

#### Linux

```bash
# Download the installer
wget https://mirror.ctan.org/systems/texlive/tlnet/install-tl-unx.tar.gz
tar -xzf install-tl-unx.tar.gz
cd install-tl-*

# Run the installer. Can take a long time.
sudo perl install-tl

# Add to PATH (add to ~/.bashrc or ~/.zshrc for persistence)
export PATH=/usr/local/texlive/2025/bin/x86_64-linux:$PATH
export MANPATH=/usr/local/texlive/2025/texmf-dist/doc/man:$MANPATH
export INFOPATH=/usr/local/texlive/2025/texmf-dist/doc/info:$INFOPATH
```

## Building Your Document

### Using latexmk (Recommended)

This repository includes a [`.latexmkrc`](./.latexmkrc) that's set up to use
the correct tools. You can build with:

```bash
latexmk thesis.tex
```

Clean build artifacts:

```bash
latexmk -c thesis.tex
```

### Without latexmk

Multiple tool runs are necessary to create all intermediate files and the bibliography:

```bash
lualatex thesis.tex
biber thesis
lualatex thesis.tex
lualatex thesis.tex
```

## Document Structure

[`thesis.tex`](./thesis.tex) is a sample for how to use the `uofithesis` class,
and includes comments and examples for all major features.

Not all elements are required, so remove any sections that don't apply to your document.
Optional parts include:

- Copyright Page
- Acknowledgements
- Appendix or Appendices

### Thesis vs Dissertation

By default, the class produces a dissertation. For a master's thesis:

```latex
\documentclass[thesis]{uofithesis}
```

## TeXstudio

**TeXstudio** must be configured to use latexmk and LuaLaTeX to build the document properly:

1. Go to Options -> Configure TeXstudio
2. Under "Commands" find "Latexmk" near the bottom. Remove the "-pdf" flag which is forcing it to not use lualatex:
   `latexmk -silent -synctex=1 %`
3. Under "Build", change Default Compiler to "Latexmk"

The document should then compile.

This repository includes a TeXstudio completion word list (CWL) for the
class-specific macros defined by `uofithesis.cls`.

CWL file: `texstudio/uofithesis.cwl`

This is not required for the template to work, but it provides autocompletion
for the custom macros. To use it, copy the `uofithesis.cwl` file to your TeXstudio user completion directory:

- Windows: `%APPDATA%\texstudio\completion\user\`
- macOS/Linux: `~/.config/texstudio/completion/user/`

After copying the file, restart TeXstudio.

## Package Groups and Accessibility

> [!WARNING]
> Always consult the [Tagging Status of LaTeX Packages](https://latex3.github.io/tagging-project/tagging-status/)
> before including a package in your document. If possible, choose a fully compatible package.

### Core Document Setup

The template uses packages that are, at time of writing, the best available for an accessible PDF output.

The [LaTeX Tagging Project](https://latex3.github.io/tagging-project/) is the foundation for an accessible PDF structure. It uses a `\DocumentMetadata` command to configure PDF/UA-2 tagging and accessibility features.

The Tagging Project is still under active development, and some features may be added or changed in future releases of TeX Live. The template is designed to be compatible with the latest stable release, but may require updates as the tagging system evolves.

### Mathematics (`unicode-math`)

**Required for accessible mathematics.** This package enables:
- MathML generation for screen reader compatibility
- Unicode math symbols for proper character encoding
- Modern OpenType math fonts
- Most other packages, such as amsmath, **are not compatible** and will not produce
  accessible math.

All equations should be wrapped in appropriate tags:

```latex
\tagstructbegin{tag=Part}
\begin{equation}\label{eq:example}
    E = mc^2
\end{equation}
\tagstructend
```

At this time, all [float environments must be wrapped in `Part`](#wrap-floats-in-part-tags) tags to ensure they are read in the correct order by screen readers.

### Graphics and Visualization

#### Core Graphics Packages

- **graphicx**: Standard image inclusion with alt-text support
- **tikz**: Programmatic diagrams with alt-text capability
- **pgfplots**: Data visualization with accessible color schemes

Note that `pgfplots` is not properly tagged and relies on alt text for accessibility.

Read [Alternative Text for Images](https://digitalaccessibility.illinois.edu/getting-started/accessibility-fundamentals/alternative-text-images) for best practices on writing alt text.

#### Accessible Color Schemes

The template defines WCAG AA compliant colors for charts:

```latex
\definecolor{aa-teal}{HTML}{168362}
\definecolor{aa-orange}{HTML}{C05402}
\definecolor{aa-blue}{HTML}{716CB2}
\definecolor{aa-pink}{HTML}{e7298a}
```

Use with pgfplots:

```
cycle list name=StrictAA,
```

#### Providing Alt Text

**All graphics must include alt text for accessibility:**

```latex
% For images
\tagstructbegin{tag=Part}
\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.6\textwidth,alt={Alt text}]{image.png}
    \caption{Image caption}
    \label{fig:image_label}
\end{figure}
\tagstructend

% For TikZ diagrams and pgfplots
\tagstructbegin{tag=Part}
    \begin{figure}[H]
        \begin{tikzpicture}[alt={Description of diagram}]
```

At this time, all [float environments must be wrapped in `Part`](#wrap-floats-in-part-tags) tags to ensure they are read in the correct order by screen readers.

Read [Alternative Text for Images](https://digitalaccessibility.illinois.edu/getting-started/accessibility-fundamentals/alternative-text-images) for best practices on writing alt text.

### Tables

Tables require proper header configuration for accessibility:

```latex
\tagstructbegin{tag=Part}
\begin{table}[H]
    \caption{Table Caption}
    \tagpdfsetup{table/header-rows={1}}  % First row is header
    \begin{tabular}{|l|l|}
        \hline
        \textbf{Header 1} & \textbf{Header 2} \\
        \hline
        Data 1 & Data 2 \\
        \hline
    \end{tabular}
\end{table}
\tagstructend
```

At this time, all [float environments must be wrapped in `Part`](#wrap-floats-in-part-tags) tags to ensure they are read in the correct order by screen readers.

For tables with header columns:

```latex
\tagpdfsetup{table/header-columns={1},table/header-rows={1}}
```

#### Advanced Tables

Using colors and merged cells in tables are challenging for accessibility. If you
must use these features, note the following:

**If you need merged cells**, use `array` and `multirow`
for the best results. They tag merged cells correctly. **Does not support colored cells.**
[multirow example](https://github.com/graduatecollege/uofithesis/issues/6#issuecomment-4057268158)

**If you need colored cells**, use `nicematrix` with the `\CodeBefore` option to 
apply colors. This tags merged cells as nested tables, which is problematic,
but is the only option that allows colored cells while still being read in a 
somewhat logical order by screen readers. [nicematrix example](https://github.com/graduatecollege/uofithesis/issues/6#issuecomment-4041274456)

`tabularray` is **not** compatible and doesn't produce usable tables.

### Bibliography (`biblatex` + `biber`)

**Biber backend is required**.:

```latex
\usepackage[backend=biber,style=ieee]{biblatex}
\addbibresource{./references.bib}

% In document:
\printbibliography[heading=bibintoc,title={References}]
```

The `style` can be changed to match your field's requirements (apa, ieee, nature, etc.).

### Chemistry Packages

**Important limitation**: `mhchem` and `chemfig` are not fully compatible with accessibility tagging, but currently have no alternatives.

```latex
\usepackage[version=4]{mhchem}  % Chemical formulas: \ce{H2O}
\usepackage{chemfig}            % Molecular structures
```

Here's a sample for how to include a chemical structure with `chemfig`:

```latex
\tagstructbegin{tag=Part}
\begin{figure}[H]
    \chemfig{...}
    \caption{Molecular structure}
\end{figure}
\tagstructend
```

At this time, all [float environments must be wrapped in `Part`](#wrap-floats-in-part-tags) tags to ensure they are read in the correct order by screen readers.

### Source Code Listings

The `listings` package will not compile with tagging enabled.

`minted` is an alternative that can be used. It requires Python 3.13 or earlier to be installed.

See [Issue #5](https://github.com/graduatecollege/uofithesis/issues/5) for discussion on this.

### Algorithms and Pseudocode

The `algorithm` and `algpseudocode` packages are compatible with tagging and can 
be used for algorithms and pseudocode. [algpseudocode example](https://github.com/graduatecollege/uofithesis/issues/8#issuecomment-4057284694)

### Other Utilities

- **csquotes**: Proper quotation handling (recommended with babel)
- **hyperref**: PDF hyperlinks (use `hidelinks` option to avoid colored boxes)
- **footmisc**: Footnote positioning control

## Accessibility Best Practices

### Always Use Sectioning

Use LaTeX's sectioning commands rather than manual formatting:

```latex
% Good
\section{Chapter Title}
\subsection{Section Title}

% Bad - will not be tagged properly
{\large\bfseries Manual Heading}
```

The PDF output will have a `<Title>` tag for the document title, and `<H1>` tags 
for top-level sections. This is consistent with PDF UA-2, and it is practically
impossible to make LaTeX Tagging do anything else.

> [!NOTE]
> The `uofithesis` class uses the `report` document class as its base,
> which uses `\section` rather than `\chapter` for top-level sections. This is
> intentional to meet the Graduate College formatting standards, as the
> `\chapter` command adds extra vertical space and page breaks that are not allowed.

### Wrap Floats in Part Tags

Wrap figures and tables in Part tags:

```latex
\tagstructbegin{tag=Part}
\begin{figure}[H]
    % content
\end{figure}
\tagstructend
```

Without this, all of the figures and tables will be read after the main text, 
which is very confusing for assistive technology.

### Provide Meaningful Alt Text

Read [Alternative Text for Images](https://digitalaccessibility.illinois.edu/getting-started/accessibility-fundamentals/alternative-text-images) for best practices on writing alt text.

### Use Raggedright

The template sets `\raggedright` by default, which is recommended for accessibility as it:
- Improves readability for dyslexic readers
- Prevents awkward spacing in justified text
- Maintains consistent word spacing

## Document Metadata

The template automatically configures document metadata for accessibility:

```latex
\DocumentMetadata{
    lang=en,
    pdfstandard=ua-2,
    tagging=on,
    tagging-setup={
        math/setup={mathml-AF,mathml-SE},
        extra-modules={verbatim-mo},
    }
}
```

PDF title is set with the `pdfusetitle` option in `hyperref`:

```latex
\usepackage[hidelinks,pdfusetitle]{hyperref}
```

## Customization

### Changing Fonts

The template uses `fontsetup` which configures sensible defaults. To use specific fonts:

```latex
\setmainfont{Stix Two Text}
```

### Section Formatting

All sections are automatically formatted per Graduate College requirements:

- 12pt bold font
- Centered
- Numbered as "Chapter N"
- Each chapter starts on a new page
- Sections within chapters do not start on new pages

## File Organization

You can split the document into multiple files for better organization. The main `thesis.tex` file should include the preamble and the overall structure, while individual chapters can be placed in separate `.tex` files.

Use `\input{chapters/chapter1.tex}` or similar to include chapter files.

## Troubleshooting

### Build Errors

#### Error: "Undefined control sequence"

- Update to the most up-to-date TeX Live version. For Overleaf, see below.
- Older versions don't support the LaTeX Tagging Project.

#### Strange build errors after adding a package

- Check the [Tagging Status of LaTeX Packages](https://latex3.github.io/tagging-project/tagging-status/) to ensure compatibility
- Incompatible packages can fail for reasons not immediately obvious when used with tagging

#### Errors and warnings in Overleaf

Enabling [Overleaf Labs](https://www.overleaf.com/labs/participate) to get access 
to the Rolling Release can reduce build issues related to the tagging system.

### Slow To Compile

The tagging system is still new and can be slow to compile, especially with 
large documents. To speed up compilation when working on the document:

- Remove packages from thesis.tex that you're not using, for example mhchem and chemfig
- Replace `tagging=on` with `tagging=off`. Note that this needs to be on for the final document.
- Remove `fontsetup`, which tends to increase compilation time.
- Enable Draft mode. In Overleaf this is in the Recompile drop-down as "Compile mode: Fast [draft]"
- Use [/includeonly](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/TeX/includeonly) to only compile the chapter you're working on.
- If you have a lot of TikZ graphics and diagrams, the Overleaf docs on [Reducing the compile time for diagrams](https://docs.overleaf.com/troubleshooting-and-support/fixing-and-preventing-compile-timeouts/reducing-the-compile-time-for-diagrams) may help.

### Known Adobe Acrobat Accessibility Issues

- Adobe Acrobat repeats the "link" word multiple times with NVDA, e.g. "link link link link Chapter 1".
- Alt text for graphics is only read up to 90 characters at a time, after which it repeats the word "graphic" and then reads the next bit.
- NVDA requires MathCAT to read math in Adobe Acrobat, and supports navigating equations.
- JAWS does not allow navigating equations in Acrobat, and reads the entire equation as one block of text.
- Complex tables with merged cells almost always have problems being read correctly in Acrobat, even with proper header configuration.
